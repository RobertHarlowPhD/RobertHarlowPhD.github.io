There remains significant pressure on the NHS and their wait time for an autism diagnosis. This strain has a huge cost on the resources and well-being of those involved. This project aims to provide new methods of diagnostic assistance to tackle these wait times. The initiative tests next-generation tools for testing neurodevelopmental conditions in everyday settings. The project utilizes neuroscience methods, such as functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIS) to measure brainwaves, voice analysis, sleep measures, and AI approaches to identify reliable biological and behavioural markers of autism. The central goal to move diagnostic and monitoring tchnologies beyond clinical settings to a more affordable, efficiant, and inclusive alternative. Co-designing this process with autistic community groups, clinicians, and data scientists will help produce tools that are scientifically valid, ethically sound, and genuinely benificial for both the NHS and wider community. Our outreach for focus groups of autistic people, those awating diagnosis, and clinicians involved in the process is still on-going!

This on-going project aims to investigate how autistic and non-autistic people process and predict the actions of other autitic and non-autistic people. Also, if the knowledge of whether the person they are obsrving is autistic or not impacts the predictive mechanisms of social perception. We are using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to measure brain waves, touch-screen computer responses, and austism questionnaires to paint the picture of how social framing and shared neurotype may influence how we percieve others. This is an on-going project that is still recruting! if you are interested, please email me - Robert.harlow@plymouh.ac.uk

My thesis investigated how predictive perception, motor coordination, and neurotype differences influences social perception in autism. It explored how these mechanisms contribute to social difficulties faced by autistic people, through the lens of the double empathy problem and second-person neuroscience.
<p>
Firstly, I investigated how spoken intentions and visual evidence guide predictive social perception. Across four experiments, results supported a dual-process model whereby top-down expectations shape early perception but are overridden by visual input once motion begins. This led to the ‘kinematic dominance hypothesis’, suggesting motion cues dominate perception once movement begins due to their higher precision in predictive social preception.
<p>
Secondly, I used high-resolution active motion capture to analyse autistic motor coordination. Autistic participants showed differences in speed and amplitude of motion during complex tasks when compared to non-autistic. These differences correlated with communication and camouflaging traits, suggesting motor differences may influence how autistic actions are interpreted in everyday contexts, with emphasis on differences in movment in achieving task goals, not 'deficits in ability'.
<p>
Finally, I tested the double empathy problem through predictive perception and diagnostic framing. Non-autistic participants altered perception when told the actor was autistic, despite identical kinematics. Yet, autistic participants showed stable perception regardless of actor neurotype. These findings bridge predictive perception and the double empathy problem, highlighting that difficulties experienced in autism may stem from environmental and relational factors, including assumptions of autistic behaviour by non-autistic observers, rather than measures of ability.
<p>
Together, my thesis presents a cohesive account of how social misunderstandings in autism may arise from perceptual, motoric, and contextual divergence rather than deficits in ability. It supports a neurodiversity-informed model of autistic sociality grounded in predictive processing, action kinematics, and behavioural interpretation. It recognises that the difficulties experienced by autistic people are not due to a deficit in ability, but from trying to navigate a world and social circumstance that has not been built with neurodiversity in mind.
