Started in early 2018 at the University of Oxford, ReproducibiliTea has now spread to 104 institutions in 25 different countries and is sponsored by the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN). Attended by both lecturers and research students at the University of Plymouth and hosted by Robert Harlow and Darya Klymenko, this bi-weekly journal club discusses diverse ideas, papers and issues on how to improve research practices, reproducibility of results, and the Open Science movement overall.
Below, you will find a blog outlining the latest ReproducibiliTea journal club sessions. You can click on the following session dropdowns to learn about what we discussed. So stick the kettle on, and enjoy!

  <h4>Topic A – <em>‘Easing into open science - A guide for graduate students and their advisors’</em></h4>

  This paper offers valuable guidance to graduate students seeking to embrace open science practices. It underscores the advantages of open science, such as enhanced transparency and collaboration in research. Importantly, the paper emphasizes that open science can be adopted gradually, providing practical steps for students to incorporate these principles into their work, including pre-registration and data sharing. Ethical considerations, such as consent and privacy, are also addressed. The paper encourages students to seek support and resources from mentors and institutions to facilitate this transition and stresses the importance of openly sharing research outputs to increase the visibility and impact of their work. In essence, it serves as a valuable roadmap for graduate students looking to integrate open science into their research endeavors. Our session introduces these concepts, allowing ‘food for thought’ (with tea) on why these practices are so important.

  <h4>Topic B – <em>‘Some reasons to use R - A discussion on R for statistical analysis’</em></h4>

  This website post by Andy Wills provides some useful reading on why using R is beneficial for research. While being free, reproducible, and with open access coding; the software provides a considerable amount of complimentary tools for the Open Science movement. However, recent discussions of student satisfaction here in Plymouth elucidate that the complexity of learning to code may act as a barrier to science for psychologists starting out, especially those who are not interested in progressing towards research based careers. Yet, the skills acquired from such are invaluable to an ever advancing society and help facilitate reproducible data. Our session explores this, while comparing other statistical analysis tools.

  This session focused on the importance of not only researchers remaining transparent in their work, with an “warts and all” approach, but also how our work is conveyed through differing writing styles. We can all reminisce having to read sections of papers several times as the lexical complexity pertaining to articulations employed in publications surpass the cognitive accessibility of an audience devoid of a scientific predisposition… ahem… yes.
This session discussed adapting science communication to a broader audience for improved accessibility, but noted the challenge of limited word counts in publications for conveying complex topics. The conversations extended to teaching experiences, highlighting the focus on developing academic writing skills, emphasizing the need for abstracts to provide layperson-friendly summaries, and underscoring the importance of early instruction to this regard. The session further explored the factors influencing changes in academic writing practices across disciplines.
